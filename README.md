# Student Mapping Project

This is the repository for the Student Mapping Project app, which is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. This app allows the user to create a "hazard map layer" by selecting provinces and cities in the Philippines that are affected by a certain hazard. The app then generates a report that identifies the students of my school who live in the affected areas. Only authorized individuals from my school may use this app.
